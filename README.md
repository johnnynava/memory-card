# Memory Card Game

[Live Demo](https://johnnynava.github.io/memory-card/)
I chose 12 movies to make the selection for and I retrieve the images and information using tmdb's api. I could have programmed this to choose ANY movie instead of 12 preselected ones but the problem with this is that tmdb also contains adult movies listed under the same database (I don't want this website to potentially display anything inaproppriate) and there's some very niche movies with low quality posters that I didn't want to be featured in my page.

Making the game up to 12 posters is enough for me to learn about the concepts that are intended to be learned from this project.
