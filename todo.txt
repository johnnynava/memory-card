problems:
//need you won page in case the user chooses 12 correct posters in a row (include a restart button to start process from zero)
//need you lost page in case the user loses (include restart button to start process from zero)
//create restart button that restarts game from zero (keep highScore and reset currentScore too)

//after everything functions:
//make it look pretty on mobile
//make effect of the cards to transition to back image and then display the new values

//implement function to display random movies instead of preselected ones? this will imply using the following: https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/movie-latest-id
//and also fetching the cards with a random array of numbers everytime a user clicks on restart or refreshes the page;
//this can be done with a isNewGame boolean prop to the card to determine whether it should start a new game (and fetch new cards with a random array of numbers) or not
//and also query for another random number in case the response is not a 200 (there are some cases in which you could hit a deleted id) - this can be verified by fetchedItems.status === 200 (response of fetch)
//what cleanup function should i add for the fetchedCardsArray?

//NOTES:
//check if there is a better way to do the useEffect function to fetch the cards
