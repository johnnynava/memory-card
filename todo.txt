//do later maybe:

//make effect of the cards to transition to back image and then display the new values (I did this but there's two problems: the effect doesn't look smooth on mobile and the effect only works properly on the first transition of the cards so I decided to comment out those lines)
//implement function to display random movies instead of preselected ones? this will imply using the following: https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/movie-latest-id
//and also fetching the cards with a random array of numbers everytime a user clicks on restart or refreshes the page;
//this can be done with a isNewGame boolean prop to the card to determine whether it should start a new game (and fetch new cards with a random array of numbers) or not
//and also query for another random number in case the response is not a 200 (there are some cases in which you could hit a deleted id) - this can be verified by fetchedItems.status === 200 (response of fetch)
//what cleanup function should i add for the fetchedCardsArray?
//use useState for fetchedCardsArray (to make the flip of cards work)

//NOTES:
//check if there is a better way to do the useEffect function to fetch the cards
